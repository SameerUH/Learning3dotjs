Finished my second session with Three.js and learnt the basics of it including a basic setup with scenes, shapes, lights, cameras, etc.

I'm still thinking of how I can implement it in future projects but I think as I learn more about this library I'll explore other options.

I'm very curious as to how the user interaction will go as when I look at other websites they have very cool features with spinning shapes when the user drags them.
