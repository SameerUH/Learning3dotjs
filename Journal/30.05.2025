Over the past couple of days  I've been learning various features such as mouse interaction with Raycasters and adding textures instead of using colours for the shapes.

I think I understand the concept of Raycasters but it may be something to understand fully with practice.

I'm hoping to learn more about animation with the shapes and adding text to them, so when it comes to my portfolio website I can include interactive projects and certifications (possibly even with pages?)

Edited:
Just learnt how to add lighting, shadows and add 3D models to scenes and objects, it was a really fun experience but now I want to direct my learning to a portfolio, web development based, path. So in future sessions I'm going to try and learn how to incorporate three.js and 3D objects to HTML and CSS files (possibly even add PHP into it.)
