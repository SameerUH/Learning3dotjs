Over the past couple of days  I've been learning various features such as mouse interaction with Raycasters and adding textures instead of using colours for the shapes.

I think I understand the concept of Raycasters but it may be something to understand fully with practice.

I'm hoping to learn more about animation with the shapes and adding text to them, so when it comes to my portfolio website I can include interactive projects and certifications (possibly even with pages?)
